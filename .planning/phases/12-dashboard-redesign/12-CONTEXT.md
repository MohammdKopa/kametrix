# Phase 12: Dashboard Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The dashboard gets a complete visual overhaul using shadcn/ui components and the Proximab-inspired premium dark theme. When users log in, they should feel like they're using a sleek, professional SaaS tool — not a startup MVP.

The focus is on the premium dark aesthetic: purple/pink gradient accents on the #06040d dark background, glassmorphic cards with blur effects and subtle borders, and radial glow effects for atmosphere. Every component should feel unified and polished.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistent shadcn/ui components** - Every button, card, form element, and table should use shadcn/ui for a unified look
- **Glassmorphic cards** - The frosted glass effect on cards is the signature visual element that makes the dashboard feel premium
- **Color gradients & glows** - Purple/pink gradient accents and radial glows define the premium feel — these need to be applied tastefully throughout

All three elements are equally important. The dashboard won't feel "done" unless components, glassmorphism, and colors all come together.

## What's Out of Scope

- Landing page redesign — that's Phase 13
- New features or functionality — this is visual polish only
- Advanced animations and scroll effects — saved for landing page phase
- Mobile-first redesign — desktop priority, mobile should just work

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Stick closely to the Proximab theme reference (https://proximab.framer.website/)
- Purple/pink accents on #06040d dark background
- Glassmorphic cards with blur effects and subtle borders
- Radial glow effects for atmosphere
- Typography: Poppins + Inter (already set up in Phase 11)
- Use the shadcn/ui components from Phase 11 as the foundation

## Additional Context

This is v1.2 milestone work — visual polish only, no new features. The goal is to make the dashboard feel premium and professional.

Phase 11 already set up:
- shadcn/ui installation and configuration
- Proximab OKLCH dark theme with CSS variables
- Core components (Button, Card, Input, Label, Badge, Avatar, Separator, Skeleton)
- Poppins + Inter typography

This phase builds on that foundation to redesign all dashboard components.
