**Phase context:**
- Vision: Professional polish with Proximab dark aesthetic
- Essential: Fix broken things while polishing, consistent visual language
- Dark mode: Glassmorphism cards, purple accents

**CRITICAL - glass-card class usage:**
- DO NOT use `dark:glass-card` - Tailwind's `dark:` variant doesn't work with custom classes
- DO use `glass-card` directly (no prefix) - The CSS `.dark .glass-card` selector handles dark mode
- DO NOT combine with `bg-white` - it overrides the glass-card background
- Pattern: Replace `bg-white ... dark:glass-card` with just `glass-card`
