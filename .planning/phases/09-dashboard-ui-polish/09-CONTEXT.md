# Phase 9: Dashboard UI Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-27
**Updated:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

## How This Should Work

The dashboard gets a professional polish with a light/dark mode toggle. Light mode stays clean and functional, dark mode takes inspiration from the Proximab design (https://proximab.framer.website/) — purple/blue gradients, glassmorphism, that premium SaaS feel.

The focus is making everything look and feel polished and cohesive. Every page should have the same visual language — consistent spacing, component styles, and transitions. The theme toggle should work everywhere seamlessly.

While polishing, also fix anything that's broken: incorrect links, routes that don't work, buttons that don't do what they should.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Overall polish feel** — Everything looking cohesive and professional across all pages and components
- **Theme toggle** — Light/dark mode switch that applies consistently everywhere
- **Working correctly** — All links, routes, and buttons function as expected
- **Proximab dark aesthetic** — Dark mode with purple/blue gradient accents, glassmorphism effects

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- New features — Only visual changes and bug fixes, no new functionality

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Dark mode inspired by Proximab: near-black backgrounds (#06040d, #0c0512), purple/blue accents (#983ad6, #681ee0)
- Glassmorphism effects on cards with subtle transparency and blur
- Light mode stays clean and functional (existing style, refined)
- Theme toggle in header/user menu area
- Smooth transitions between themes

## Additional Context

Design reference: https://proximab.framer.website/

This is about taking a working dashboard and making it shine. The v1.0 MVP shipped functional — now it's time for that premium polish with proper dark mode support.
