# Phase 22: Euro Currency - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Simple symbol swap throughout the entire platform. Every place that shows $ should show € instead. The actual numbers stay the same — if something costs $10, it becomes €10. No complex currency conversion or formatting changes.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Complete consistency** — Every single $ becomes €, no mixed currencies anywhere on the platform
- User-facing pages, admin dashboard, pricing copy, credit displays — everything uses Euro

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No actual price value changes (just symbol swap)
- No number format localization (keeping 1,234.56 format, not switching to German 1.234,56)
- No currency conversion logic

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements - straightforward symbol replacement across all displays.

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of v2.1 Prompt & Voice Excellence milestone. The platform is targeting the German market, so Euro is the natural currency choice.
