# Phase 13: Landing Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When someone lands on Kametrix, they should feel like they're entering something premium — bold and immersive from the first moment. The hero should feel like a commanding dark void with a radial glow pulling you in, headline front and center. Deep black/purple space that makes an immediate statement.

As visitors scroll, the page should unfold like a story. Sections reveal and transform — fading and sliding in as you scroll. The experience should feel curated and intentional, not just a static page you scroll through.

The whole thing should say "this is premium software" before anyone reads a word.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual wow factor** — The design itself should make people think "this is premium" before they read anything. The look IS the pitch.
- **Radial glow behind hero** — That signature purple/pink glow emanating from behind the main headline, creating depth and drawing the eye
- **Glassmorphic feature cards** — Blurred glass-effect cards for features/benefits sections, continuing the premium dark theme from the dashboard

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Mobile optimization — Focus on desktop wow-factor first, mobile can be basic/functional
- Content strategy changes — Keep existing sections and copy, this is purely visual redesign
- New pages or sections — Only redesigning what exists

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Proximab reference (https://proximab.framer.website/) for the overall aesthetic
- Dark void hero with radial purple/pink glow
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations — sections fade/slide in as you scroll
- Glassmorphic cards with backdrop blur for feature sections
- Consistent with dashboard's premium dark theme established in Phase 11-12

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of v1.2 (shadcn/ui & Premium Dark Theme milestone). The dashboard has already been redesigned with the Proximab-inspired theme in Phases 11-12, so this landing redesign should feel cohesive with that work.

Priority is clearly visual impact over everything else. The landing page is the first impression — it needs to match the premium feel of the dashboard users will see after signup.
