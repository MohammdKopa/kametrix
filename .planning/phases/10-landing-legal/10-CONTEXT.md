# Phase 10: Landing & Legal Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The landing page tells a story-driven journey that leads with simplicity: "Deploy AI phone support in minutes." Small business owners land on the page and immediately understand what Kametrix does and why it's different from complex enterprise solutions.

The page flows through sections that build the narrative — starting with the clear value proposition, then walking visitors through features, how it works, and ending with a compelling call to action. The visual style draws from premium dark SaaS aesthetics (reference: proximab.framer.website) with deep purple/black gradients and glowing accents.

Legal pages (Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB) and cookie consent banner provide solid German compliance — nothing fancy, just correct and complete.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear value prop in 5 seconds** — Within moments of landing, visitors understand what this is and why they need it. Messaging is everything.
- **Simplicity-first positioning** — Differentiate from complex enterprise solutions. This is AI phone support that deploys in minutes, not months.
- **Solid German legal compliance** — Impressum, privacy policy, and terms that meet German requirements properly.

## What's Out of Scope

- Blog or content pages — no resource center, no content marketing, just landing + legal
- Multi-language — German only for now, English version comes later
- Advanced marketing features — no A/B testing, analytics dashboards, or conversion tracking
- Complex animations — keep it performant and clean

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Dark gradient hero section inspired by Proximab reference — deep purple/black with glowing accents for premium SaaS vibe
- Adapt Proximab aesthetic freely to what works for Kametrix rather than copying exactly
- Story flow: hero → value prop → features → how it works → CTA
- Cookie consent banner for GDPR compliance

## Additional Context

Reference site: https://proximab.framer.website/
- Dark-themed, sophisticated premium feel
- Deep purples, blacks, electric purple accents
- Poppins/Inter fonts
- Gradient borders and backgrounds
- Card-based layouts

This completes v1.1 (German Market & Polish) when shipped.
