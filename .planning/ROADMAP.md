# Roadmap: Kametrix

## Overview

Kametrix evolves from an empty Next.js project to a complete self-serve voice AI platform. We start with foundational infrastructure and authentication, build out user-facing dashboards, integrate Vapi for voice agents, connect Google services for calendar and logging, add Stripe payments with credit tracking, and finish with polish and deployment configuration. Post-MVP, we localize for the German market and polish the UI.
